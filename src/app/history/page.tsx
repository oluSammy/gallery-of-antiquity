            History Of Lagos
          </h2>
          <p>
            The island of Lagos was inhabited by Yoruba fishermen and hunters at
            least since the 15th century. In 1472, Portuguese explorers arrived,
            and began to trade, eventually followed by other Europeans. The area
            fell under the domain of Benin in the 16th century. By 1600, it
            served as a frontier town, and Benin limited its local presence to
            soldiers led by four military commanders. This military presence as
            well as the exchange with European traders resulted in economic
            growth, as locals would travel along the coast and from further
            inland to Lagos Island for trade; at this point, clothes were the
            main item sold at and exported from the island as well as Benin as a
            whole. In the 17th century, the trade with the Portuguese also began
            to increase, as Onim became a center of the Atlantic slave trade.
            The local obas (kings) developed good relations with the Portuguese.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            By the early 19th century, it was a small kingdom and a tributary to
            the Oyo Empire. Like many West African states, Onim developed strong
            diplomatic as well as economic links to South America. It sent
            embassies to the Portuguese colony of Brazil, and became one of the
            first countries to recognize the independence of Brazil in 1823.
            Meanwhile, the Oyo Empire had begun to collapse. This allowed Lagos
            to assume the leading economic position regionally, becoming the
            most important market in the Yoruba territories as well as growing
            substantially.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8">
            From the crowning of Ado as its Oba, Lagos (then called Eko) had
            served as a major center for slave-trade, from which then Oba of
            Benin and all of his successors for over two centuries supported â€”
            until 1841, when Oba Akitoye ascended to the throne of Lagos and
            attempted to ban slave trading. Local merchants strongly opposed the
            intended move, and deposed and exiled the king, and installed
            Akitoye&#39;s brother Kosoko as Oba. Exiled to Europe, Akitoye met with
            British authorities, who had banned slave trading in 1807, and who
            therefore decided to support the deposed Oba to regain his throne.
            In the &#39;Reduction of Lagos&#39;, the British militarily intervened in
            1851, reinstalling Akitoye as Oba of Lagos. Lagos subsequently
            signed a treaty which ushered in the British consular period. In
            practical terms, however, British influence over the kingdom had
            become absolute.

                  All Obas of Lagos trace their lineage to Ashipa,a war captain
                  of the Oba of Benin. Ashipa was rewarded with the title of the
                  Oloriogun (or War leader) and received the Oba of Benin&#39;s
                  sanction to govern Lagos on his behalf. Some Benin accounts of
                  history have the Ashipa as son or grandson of the Oba of
                  Benin. Other accounts note that Ashipa is a Yoruba corruption
                  of the Benin name Aisika-hienbore (translated &#39;we shall
                  not desert this place&#39;).

                <p className="mt-8">
                  Ashipa received a sword and royal drum as symbols of his
                  authority from the Oba of Benin on his mission to Lagos.
                  Additionally, the Oba of Benin deployed a group of Benin
                  officers charged with preserving Benin&#39;s interests in
                  Lagos. These officers, led by Eletu Odibo, were the initial
                  members of the Akarigbere class of Lagos White Cap Chiefs.
